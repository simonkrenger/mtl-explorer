# BRouter sidecar (route-planner feature)

This directory builds a self-contained Docker image that runs
[BRouter](https://brouter.de) — a light-weight OSM-based bicycle/hiking/car
router that fits comfortably on a Raspberry Pi or Synology NAS.

The image is **optional**. It is only required if you want the in-app
route-planner feature. All other MTL Explorer functionality works without it.

## Architecture

Two processes run inside the container under a small Python supervisor:

| Port   | Process                | Purpose                                         |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 17777  | BRouter (Java)         | `GET /brouter?lonlats=...&profile=...&format=geojson` |
| 17778  | Admin HTTP (Python)    | `GET /status`, `GET /health`, `POST /prewarm`   |

BRouter ships with routing profiles (`trekking.brf`, `fastbike.brf`,
`hiking-mountain.brf`, `car-eco.brf`) and embedded SRTM elevation data.
It does **not** ship rd5 routing segments — those 5°×5° files are downloaded
from <https://brouter.de/brouter/segments4/> on demand and cached in the
`brouter-segments` Docker volume.

The MTL Explorer server (`PlannerAutoPrewarmService`) POSTs the bounding box of
all imported tracks to `/prewarm` on startup, so the segments covering the
user's known area are fetched in the background before the first route request.

## Run standalone (no MTL Explorer)

```bash
docker build -t mytraillog-brouter:local docker-brouter
docker run --rm -p 17777:17777 -p 17778:17778 \
  --memory 512m --memory-swap 512m \
  -v brouter-segments:/segments4 \
  mytraillog-brouter:local

# Once running, a minimal route request (Zürich HB → Zürich Flughafen):
curl "http://localhost:17777/brouter?lonlats=8.5402,47.3784|8.5517,47.4515&profile=trekking&alternativeidx=0&format=geojson"

# Segment status:
curl http://localhost:17778/status
```

The image defaults to a fixed 128 MiB Java heap, an 8 MiB young generation,
two active processors, and a 300-second route timeout. The Compose container
limit is 512 MiB. The validated floor is 384 MiB; adding 20 percent gives
460.8 MiB, which is rounded up to a conventional allocation. The JVM, Python
supervisor, and rd5 file cache are not part of the Java heap.
The app-side Compose timeout is 310 seconds so BRouter can return its own result
or timeout for long routes instead of being cut off after the server default of
8 seconds.
Override `BROUTER_JAVA_XMX`, `BROUTER_JAVA_XMS`,
`BROUTER_JAVA_YOUNG_GENERATION`, `BROUTER_JAVA_ACTIVE_PROCESSORS`, or
`BROUTER_JAVA_MAX_RUNNING_TIME_SEC` only after testing representative long
routes.

## Run as a MTL Explorer sidecar

Defined in the root `docker-compose.yml` and started with the normal home install stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

> [!TIP]
> If you are setting up MTL Explorer for the first time, follow the standard **[README Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start)** to bring up the entire stack, including this BRouter sidecar.
