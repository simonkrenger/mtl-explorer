## What it is

MTL Explorer imports Garmin, GPX, and FIT tracks, shows them on a map, analyzes
track statistics, replays activities with a cinematic 3D camera, and can plan
routes with BRouter. It is designed for self-hosting with Docker Compose.
Location search runs in a separate GeoNames SQLite sidecar.

See the [feature overview](documentation/features.md) for the current capability list.

[Why I built MTL Explorer](documentation/why-i-built-mtl-explorer.md): the project started
from the need to see thousands of Garmin tracks on one map, then grew into a
personal exploration, planning, and statistics tool.

Note: MTL Explorer is a long-running personal project. This GitHub repository is
a recently published public mirror; primary development happens in a private
repository, so the public commit history may look younger than the project
itself and may not include all intermediate steps. AI tools helped polish parts
of the user experience, but MTL Explorer is not an automatically generated
project. Even with the most advanced AI tools available today, that is not (yet?)
possible.

Repository layout:

- `mtl-server/` - Spring Boot backend.
- `mtl-client/` - Vue 3 and TypeScript PWA.
- `mtl-api/` - OpenAPI schema and generated TypeScript clients.
- `docker-brouter/` - BRouter sidecar.
- `docker-maps/` - optional local vector map sidecar.
- `docker-location-search/` - GeoNames SQLite location-search sidecar.
- `docker/` - import and demo-data helpers.

## Quick start

Prerequisite: Docker Engine and the Docker Compose plugin must be installed and support `docker compose`.

1. Start the stack:

   * **macOS, Linux, WSL, or Git Bash**:
     ```bash
     mkdir mtl-explorer && cd mtl-explorer
     curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindalyze-com/mtl-explorer/main/docker-compose.yml
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   * **Windows PowerShell**:
     ```powershell
     mkdir mtl-explorer; cd mtl-explorer
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mindalyze-com/mtl-explorer/main/docker-compose.yml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yml"
     docker compose up -d
     ```

   *(Note: The server takes about 10-15 seconds to boot up and initialize the database on first run.)*

2. Open **`http://localhost:18080/mtl/`** and log in:
   * **User**: `mtl`
   * **Password**: `change-me`

To import your tracks, copy GPX/FIT files into the `./data/gpx/` folder.

Change the default login before exposing MTL Explorer outside your home
network. For custom logins, directories, offline maps, and reverse proxy setup,
see the [home install guide](documentation/home-install.md).
